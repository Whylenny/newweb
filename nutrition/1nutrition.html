<h2>Fiber is the new protein</h2>
<h3>There are very few cases of protein deficiency (kwashiorkor) but over 90% of Americans are not getting enough fiber. The minimum recommended amount is 25 - 30 grams but the average American is eating only 15 grams. <br>The fiber is actually not digestible!  In fact it is food for the microbiome - the microbes that live in the large intestine. In exchange for providing them fiber they provide us many health benefits. They are the main source of serotonin (the happiness neurotransmitter). </h3><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CLjQ772f/2022-12-16-10-01-35.png">
