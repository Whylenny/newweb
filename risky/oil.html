    <h1>Oil is Calorie Dense</h1>
    <h3> That's why we like it. In times of scarcity it is important to eat enough and our bodies reward us when we consume high calorie foods. (Dopamine is secreted which we experience as pleaseure.) 
    We also like to feel full but oil doesn't give that feeling.</h3>
    <h3>In times of plenty there is a danger of getting too much oil. Eating too much oil (and fat) can:<br>
        . weaken the intestinal lining eventually leading to "leaky gut"<br>
        . relax the lower exophageal sphincter (entrance to the stomach) leading to heartburn and acid reflux<br>
        . impair insulin's ability to transport sucrose into the muscle cells leading to high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes.<br><br>
