    <h1>Tobacco</h1>
<h3>We are all aware of the increased risk of heart disease and cancer from tobacco use. It took more than 4000 studies proving this link before the surgeon general's warning was placed on tobacco products and use of tobacco started to decline.<br><br>It was many years later that the tobacco companies finally admitted that nicotine was addictive.  During that time scientists hired by the tobacco companies created lots of erroneous studies questioning the harmfulness of tobacco.<br><br>Since then the tobacco companies have bought up food production companies and are now using the same tactics to promote their food products. </h3>
