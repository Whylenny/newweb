      <!--Six Pillars-->
      Adoption of the six pillars of lifestyle medicine can relieve the symptoms
      and in many cases reverse the progress of these diseases. It can also
      improve the quality of life for those suffering from non-lifestyle
      challenges such as trauma and disability.<br />
      This means you can adopt habits which improve your health and discard
      habits which harm your health. The six pillars provide a framework you can
      use to organize your activities.<br /><br />
